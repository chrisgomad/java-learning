## Daily Record:
[//]: # (You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly.)

[//]: # (***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***)

| What content plan to cover  | Technical learning: Java 11 essentials, completing course. Project work: Confirm access to repo and start working on tasks.                                                                                                         |   
| What content I actually covered | Technical learning: Completed Java 11 essentials course. Project work: submitted test cases in testing environment.                                                                                                                 |  
| Reflection on what I learned today | mainly practicing with converting strings, looking deeper into Objects and how to work with loops and conditional statements. On the project side learned about system integration testing and practicing with different scenarios. |   
| Reflection on how I learned today | Very good day today. Completed all my tasks and was able to finish on time and on track.                                                                                                                                            |
| Reflections for the following day| Split time between Selenium training and project setup. Emphasis small breaks throughout the day for enhanced focus and concentration.
