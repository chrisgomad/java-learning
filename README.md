## Daily Record:
[//]: # (You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly.)

[//]: # (***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***)

| What content plan to cover  | Going through Selenium training. Project side, finishing test script creation and creating another test script.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |   
| What content I actually covered | Completed Mastering XPath and CSS selectors course. Tested out some test scripts on the project side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  
| Reflection on what I learned today | Learning to use Xpath and CSS selectors to find elements on a page. Learned about parent-child element relationships and how to create loops to retrieve certain information. On the project side, troubleshooting how to create a scenario in the testing environment including phone number and confirming bug was removed. |   
| Reflection on how I learned today | It was a good day. Time was split evenly and tasks were completed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Reflections for the following day| Split time between Selenium training and project setup. Emphasis small breaks throughout the day for enhanced focus and concentration.
