## Daily Record:
[//]: # (You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly.)

[//]: # (***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***)

| What content plan to cover  | Will be finishing a test script today and then creating other test scripts for potential failed cases.                                                                                                    |   
| What content I actually covered | Going through Selenium training, stopped at how to create dependencies. Project side writing a script for an issue that was raised. Will finish tomorrow.                                                 |  
| Reflection on what I learned today | I learned about TestNG and different aspects of testing and exception handling with Selenium. Project side learned about debugging and different methods needed to create a new feature or test scenario. |   
| Reflection on how I learned today | It was a good day. Time was split evenly and tasks were completed.                                                                                                                                        |
| Reflections for the following day| Split time between Selenium training and project setup. Emphasis small breaks throughout the day for enhanced focus and concentration.
