## Daily Record:
[//]: # (You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly.)

[//]: # (***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***)

| What content plan to cover  | HP-UFT 12.0 Automation: Object Properties - Demo Scripts & OR's. Project side: Work on new script. Manual application submission.                                                                                       |   
| What content I actually covered | HP-UFT 12.0 Automation: Object Properties - Demo Scripts & OR's. Also learned about building visibility remotely. Project side: Testing different scripts in framework. Ran regression and fixed some bugs in the code. |  
| Reflection on what I learned today | Learned about difference between descriptive programming techniques and standard OR's. Project side learning how to debug and understand where errors are happening better.                                             |   
| Reflection on how I learned today | I would say a successful day in terms of completion. Completed all tasks.                                                                                                                                               |
| Reflections for the following day| Set clear tasks based on allotted time and use pomodoro technique to accomplish those tasks and avoid getting distracted.
