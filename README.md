## Daily Record:
[//]: # (You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly.)

[//]: # (***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***)

| What content plan to cover  | Katalon Practitioner cert - Create 6 cases. Project side, complete final edits to previous scripts and start working on new test case.                                                                                |   
| What content I actually covered | Katalon created 3 cases working towards practitioner cert. Project side finished and pushed  changes to repo. Also ran tests in different environments.                                                               |  
| Reflection on what I learned today | practicing creating test cases using record and playback and manual mode in katalon. Learned more of project framework.                                                                                               |   
| Reflection on how I learned today | It was a good day. Completed all tasks except test cases.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Reflections for the following day| Split time between Katalon training and project setup. Emphasis on small breaks throughout the day for enhanced focus and concentration. Limit distractions and allow only instrumental music for peak concentration.
