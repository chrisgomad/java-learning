## Daily Record:
[//]: # (You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly.)

[//]: # (***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***)

| What content plan to cover  | Professional learning: Effective communication cards. Technical learning: Java 11 essentials. Project: Confirm access to repo and work on any relevant tasks.      |   
| What content I actually covered | Java 11 essentials and Maven setup.                                                                                                                                |  
| Reflection on what I learned today | Using classes and setting up environment for practicing. Also working with Maven and how to install and use dependencies.                                          |   
| Reflection on how I learned today | Today was a good day. I completed tasks that I had set out for the day. I wished I had more time for project tasks but I can get more of that done on project day. |
| Reflections for the following day| Split time between Selenium training and project setup.
