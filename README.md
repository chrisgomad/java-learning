## Daily Record:
[//]: # (You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly.)

[//]: # (***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***)

| What content plan to cover  | Technical learning: completing Mastering Xpath and CSS selectors course.  Project work: Working with team member to run 2-3 test scenarios that failed previous day. Practice using Jira.                       |   
| What content I actually covered | Technical learning: Mastering Xpath and CSS selectors. Stopped at XPath using text. Project work: Created a new script/test case and debugged to make sure scenario was working properly.                       |  
| Reflection on what I learned today | Learning about locating elements with Selenium. Then started pracitcing using Xpath as a method to find elements on a page. Project side learned how to create a test scenario in a pre-production environment. |   
| Reflection on how I learned today | I'd say it was a good day. Completed my tasks with ease and minimal distractions. Didn't get to fully complete technical course since I knew it was long in duration. I will complete tomorrow.                 |
| Reflections for the following day| Split time between Selenium training and project setup. Emphasis small breaks throughout the day for enhanced focus and concentration.
