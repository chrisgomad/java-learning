## Daily Record:
[//]: # (You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly.)

[//]: # (***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***)

| What content plan to cover  | VBScripting Fundamentals: Conditional statements - FSO Working with folders. Project side: Daily environment execution, finish new script.                                                                                                                           |   
| What content I actually covered | VBScripting Fundamentals: Conditional statements - Section 6 Built in functions. Project: Daily environment execution, finishing new script.                                                                                                                         |  
| Reflection on what I learned today | Learning basics of VBScripting like conditional statements, loops, and procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                   |   
| Reflection on how I learned today | I would say a moderately successful day in terms of completion. I completed most of the training tasks. Haven't really been learning much since there is greater emphasis on completion rather than comprehension. Project side almost finished creating new script. |
| Reflections for the following day| Set clear tasks based on allotted time and use pomodoro technique to accomplish those tasks and avoid getting distracted.
